title: Hello World and How this blog is built
---

After hours of work today, my blog is finally online! Quite excited! 

I will be recording my progress here, and enjoying sharing my learning with everyone. 

Human knowledge belongs to the whole world. 

I searched for the easiest way to do it, and here are the 3 steps: 

1. Purchased a domain "ITrocks.pro" from "wanwang.aliyun.com", which is the biggest supplier as it claims.
2. Create our Jekyll powered website by Forking A Starting Point on http://www.github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now, Host it on my GitHub account, and use my own domain.
3. Customize the Website by updating the variables in _config.yml file and make new post on Github desktop, then publish it.
